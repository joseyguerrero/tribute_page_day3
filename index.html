                    <li> Gandhi was many things to many people, although he has tended to be associated primarily with the Indian independence movement.  </li>
                    <li> Mahatma Gandhi was born on 2 October, 1869 Porbandar, Gujarat.</li>
                     <li> Gandhi led the fight for Indian independence from the British Empire and organized several non-violent civil disobedience campaigns. During these campaigns, large groups of the Indian population would do things like refusing to work, sitting in the streets, boycotting the courts, and more. </li>
                    <li> One of Gandhi's most successful protests was called the Salt March. When Britain put a tax on salt, Gandhi decided to walk 241 miles to the sea in Dandi to make his own salt. </li>
                    <li> The country against whom he fought for India's Independence, Great Britain, released a stamp honouring him, 21 years after his death.</li>
                    <li> In 1930, he was the Time Magazine Man of the Year. He was a great writer and the Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi have 50,000 pages.</li>
                    <li> Gandhi was a teenage newlywed. At 13, Gandhi wed Kasturba Makanji (1869-1944), also a teen. It was an arranged marriage, and they had been engaged to Kasturba since he was seven. The couple went on to have four sons. </li>
                    <li> His birthday is a national holiday in India. It is also the International Day of Non-Violence.</li>
                    <li> While walking to a prayer meeting in New Delhi on the evening of January 30, 1948, Gandhi was shot three times at close range by Hindu nationalist Nathuram Godse. Godse blamed Gandhi for going along with the 1947 plan that partitioned British India along religious lines into two new independent states: Hindu-dominated India and Muslim-dominated Pakistan.  Following the partition, riots broke out across India between Hindus and Muslims, and Godse was angered by Gandhi’s calls for an end to the bloodshed and believed the pacifist icon was pandering to Muslims. Godse was quickly apprehended after Gandhi’s murder, and in November 1949 he and a co-conspirator were hanged for their crimes.</li>
                    <li> The 1982 movie Gandhi won the Academy Award for best motion picture.</li>
